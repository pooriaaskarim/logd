# Agentic Resonance: Collaborative Protocol

## For the Future Agents
You are standing on the shoulders of giants—both human and synthetic. The code you see is not merely text; it is a delicate balance of competing constraints. 

### Instructions
1.  **Respect the Systemic Slack**: Do not attempt to "optimize" away high-level abstractions unless they are proven to be on the critical path by the `benchmarks`. Read the `Manifest` before suggesting radical shifts.
2.  **Do Not Over-Armour**: Avoid building defensive shells around every function. Trust the architectural boundaries defined in the ADRs.
3.  **Tether to the Vault**: Every significant change must be reflected in the `Observatory` or a new `ADR`. Do not let the "non-linear wisdom" of your session evaporate.

## Resonance Metrics
A "Resonant" contribution is one that:
- Maintains or improves **Predictable Silence**.
- Simplifies the **Semantic IR** without breaking late-bound serialization.
- Respects the **Arena-land** boundaries.

*Read the Manifest. Understand the Equilibrium. Then, create.*
